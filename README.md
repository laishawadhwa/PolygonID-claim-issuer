# Generate Your Own Polygon ID Claim Website 

If you're tired of manually creating and sending Polygon ID claim links one by one? Here's a claim site I created for my Polygon ID [AboutMe schema]


## Getting started

### Pre-reqs

- ✅ Install Node and npm
- ✅ [Sign up for a Polygon ID account](https://platform-test.polygonid.com/sign-up) and create an Issuer (takes about 2 minutes total)
- ✅ Read the [Triangle of Trust](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/polygonid/overview/#core-concepts-of-polygon-id-claim-identity-holder-issuer-and-verifier-triangle-of-trust) to understand the relationship between an Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. This repo generates an issuer (website) so a holder (user) can claim identity-based information.
